# Aztec Sequencer Node Setup 🚀

A step-by-step, beginner-friendly guide to run your **Aztec Sequencer Node**, written by **Nitesh Kumar**.

---

## 🖥️ System Requirements

- **OS:** Ubuntu 20.04 or newer (VPS recommended)
- **CPU:** 4 cores minimum
- **RAM:** 8GB minimum
- **Disk:** 100GB SSD recommended
- **Network:** Stable internet connection

If you're using your personal computer, make sure **Docker** stays running in the background.

## ✅ What You Need Before Starting

1️⃣ **Docker & Docker Compose**\
These handle the containers your node needs.

2️⃣ **Aztec CLI**\
Installed automatically with the script below.

3️⃣ **Sepolia RPC & Beacon RPC**\
Get free RPC endpoints from trusted sites:

- [Alchemy](https://www.alchemy.com/)
- [Infura](https://www.infura.io/)
- [QuickNode](https://www.quicknode.com/)

4️⃣ **Sepolia Test ETH**\
You need a small balance to run the sequencer. Get free test ETH from:

- [Alchemy Sepolia Faucet](https://www.alchemy.com/faucets/ethereum-sepolia)
- [Chainlink Faucet](https://faucets.chain.link/sepolia)
- [QuickNode Faucet](https://faucet.quicknode.com/ethereum/sepolia)

5️⃣ **Wallet Address & Private Key**\
Use a test wallet only. Never use your main wallet key!

## ⚡ Install Everything Automatically

Run this command in your terminal:

```bash
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/niteshkumar144/aztec-setup/main/aztec.sh | bash
```

This installs Node.js, Docker, Docker Compose, and the Aztec CLI.

---

## 📡 Start a Screen Session

Run:

```bash
screen -S aztec
```

**Why?** This keeps your node running even if you close your terminal.
